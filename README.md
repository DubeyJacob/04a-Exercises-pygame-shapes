The objective of the first exercise is to comment on the lines of code (line by line) and explain what was
happening in each line as it related to the program as a whole. The end product was a simple black screen
which is what should be present once you hit run. The comments do nothing to the actual program.

The second exercise is a program that once run, it will display rectangles of random sizes and random
colours. This exercise required editing and adding lines of code. The main blocks that are used are the 
main() block as well as the game loop. The main() function simply defined some of the variables that would
be used in the program. Then in the game loop, the events that occur in the program once you hit play are 
organized. For instance the color is defined as well as the attributes for the rectangle including color,
height, width, and position on the screen in relation to the screen size. The rectangles will appear
infinitely or until the program is stopped by closing out of the window.

The third exercise displays a digital clock on the black screen. The methods used to show the current time
is defined and converted to a string so that it is able to be displayed on the screen. It appears along 
side the text 'Hello World!'.

The fourth and final exercise is a program that once run, shows a blank, black screen, but where ever the 
user clicks with the mouse button, a circle of random size and color appears. Similar to exercise two, but
instead of randomly placing the circle, it takes the position of the mouse button, and then within the
event of the user clicking the mouse button, a circle appears at that current position. The program will
run indefinitely until the user closes the window.
